\begin{abstract}
In this Letter we explore the characteristics of the Local Group (LG)
location in the cosmic web using a cosmological simulation in the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
We use the Hessian of the gravitational potential to define the cosmic web, 
where regions are classified as either peak, sheet, filament or void.
%We use a description for the cosmic web that uses the Hessian of the
%gravitational potential to classify a neighborhod in the simulation
%as either peak, sheet, filament or void. 
Results indicate: 
i) The LG pairs are preferentially located in filaments and sheets,
ii) There is a strong signature that LG pairs orientation depends on the cosmic web, 
in particular for pairs in filaments/sheets the orbital angular momentum tends to be perpendicular to the filament direction or the sheet plane.
iii) They are located in in a narrow range of local overdensity $0<\delta<4$, 
ellipticity $0.1<e<1.0$ and prolateness $-0.5<p<0.5$. 
%Furthermore we find a strong anti-alignment between the
%LG angular momentum vector and the filament lines and the sheet planes.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%lg rare
The configuration of galaxies in the Local Group (LG hereafter) is
quite rare to find in the local Universe and in cosmological
simulations. The LG is dominated by the two big spirals MW and M31, the next
most-luminous galaxy is M33 which is $\sim 10$ times less massive than
M31, followed by several less luminous dwarf galaxies, up to a
distance of $\sim 3$\mpc.   The velocity vector of M31, with a low
tangential velocity is consistent to a head-on collision orbit toward
the MW
\citep{2008MNRAS.386..461C,2012ApJ...753....8V,2012ApJ...753....7S}.   

Another feature of the Local group is the relatively low velocity
dispersion of nearby galaxies up to $\sim 8$ Mpc \citep[][and
  references therein]{1975ApJ...196..313S,2011MNRAS.415L..16A}. 
Environment around the Local Group has density quite close to the
average density of the universe
\citep{2003ApJ...596...19K,2005AJ....129..178K}. In addition, the
closest massive galaxy cluster, the Virgo Cluster, is $\approx
16.5\ \mpc$ away \citep{2007ApJ...655..144M}.  

All this combination of features make LG analogues very rare to
find. Using numerical simulatons \citet{lganalogues} found less than
$2\%$ MW-sized halos reside in a pair similar to MW-M31 and in a
similar environment. Furthermore, if we select pairs constrained
within $2\sigma$ error fron current observational measurements of the
velocity components and distance to M31, there are only $46$ systems
in a cube of $250$ \hmpc side. 

\citet{2013ApJ...767L...5F} also studied MW-M31 pairs in numerical
simulations finding the typical quantities characterizing the orbital
parameters of the LG are rare among typical pairs, but not enough to
challenge the \lcdm model. 
Another definition of LG analogues is made by
\citet{2008MNRAS.384.1459L}, but despite differences ocurr in the
definitions and resulting fraction of LG analogues, all are in
agreement with a low frequency of these pairs. 
%lw08 also look lg analogues

%larger scales & lg env
To better understand the properties of the LG and how this uncommon
pair configuration fit in the cosmological context, an immediate
question arise. What else can we say of the LG at larger scales?. In
particular, which are the typical/prefered locations of these systems
within the Cosmic Web?.

Looking the LG at larger scales we have it is located in a difuse and
warped filament/wall conecting Virgo Cluster with Fornax Cluster, some
nearby galaxies and groups members of this large structure are the
Maffei group, NGC $6744$, NGC $5128$, $M101$, $M81$, $NGC1023$, Cen A
group. At this scale, there is no evident alignment of the MW-M31
orbital plane with the local filament or the Virgo-Fornax
direction. However, if we look in a smaller volume below scales of
$\sim 6$ \mpc, there is a clear alignment of th the MW-M31 orbit with
a local plane as shown by figure $3$ in \citet{2013AJ....146...69C}.  


%Tweb definition
The environment definition we use in this Letter uses the tidal tensor
field. 

%this paper.
In this Letter we study the large scale environment of LG 
analogues in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. We use the Bolshoi
simulation to explore in what structures they reside and if there is
any correlation or alignment with the cosmic web. The large scale
Environment is defined by the cosmic web components identified by
\citet{Tweb}, and we use the LG analogues computed by
\citet{lganalogues}. We pay spetial attention to quantify the kind of
environment that hosts LG pairs and their alignments with respect to
the prefered directions defined by the T-web. 
   
This Letter is organized as follows. In Section \ref{sec:simulation}
we present the N-body cosmological simulation and the algorithm to
define the cosmic web, next in \ref{sec:lg_analogues} we describe the
sample of LG analogues extracted from the simulation. In
Section \ref{sec:results} we presents our results to continue with a
discussion about their implications for our Local Group in Section
\ref{sec:discussion} to finally conclude in Section
\ref{sec:conclusions}. 


\section{Simulation and web finding algorithm}
\label{sec:simulation}

\subsection{The Bolshoi simulation}
We use the Bolshoi simulation of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology: $\Omega_{\rm
  m}=1-\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.27$, $H_0=70\,\rm km/s/Mpc$,
$\sigma_8=0.82$, $n_s=0.95$ \citep{2011ApJ...740..102K}, compatible
with the constraints from the WMAP satellite
\citep{hinshaw_etal13}. The simulation followed evolution of dark
matter in a $250 \hmpc$ box with spatial resolution of $\approx
1h^{-1}$~kpc and mass resolution of $m_{\rm p}=1.35\times 10^8\ \rm
M_{\odot}$. Halos are identified with the BDM algorithm
\citep{1997astro.ph.12217K}. The BDM algorithm is  a spherical
overdensity halo finding algorithm and is designed to identify both
host halos and subhalos. 


\subsection{Cosmic web identification}
The web finding algorithm is based on the tidal tensor computed as the
Hessian of the  gravitational potential field

\begin{equation}
T_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial r_i \partial r_j}, 
\end{equation}
%
where $r_{i}$, $i=1,2,3$ refers to the three spatial comoving
coordiates and $\phi$ is the gravitational potential renormalized to
follow the following Poisson equation $\nabla^2\phi=\delta$ where
$\delta$ is the matter overdensity.  

This tensor is real and symmetric, which means that can be
diagonalized. We note its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq
\lambda_3$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $\hat{e}_1$,
$\hat{e}_2$ and $\hat{e}_3$. The web classification compares each one
of the three eigenvalues to a threshold value $\lambda_{\rm th}$. If
the three, two, one or zero eigenvalues are larger than this threshold
the region is classified as peak, filament, sheet or void,
respectively.  

\cite{Tweb} performed a detailed study for the topology of the
cosmic web and its visual counterpart as a function of the parameter
$\lambda_{\rm th}$. They found that reasonable results in terms of the
volume fraction occupied by voids, the visual inspection and the halo
populations in each web type can be reached by values of $0.2<\lambda_{\rm
th}<0.4$. In this Letter we choose the value of $\lambda_{\rm
  th}=0.3$ to proceed with our analysis. We have veryfied that the
main trends reported in this paper are unsensitive to the choice of
that parameter, as long as it is in the range already quoted.

The algorithm to compute the potential is grid based. First we
interpolate the density into a cubic grid with a Cloud-In-Cell (CIC)
scheme and smooth it with a gaussian kernel. Then we obtain the
gravitational potential using FFT methods and use finite differences
to compute the Hessian at every point in the grid. In our case we have
used a grid size on and a gaussian smoothing with two times larger as
the typical separation between the two halos in the Local Group. The
purpose of this choice is to have both halos in the pair a common
environment. In this paper we use a grid spacing of $s=0.97$ \hMpc,
corresponding to a $256^3$ grid in the Bolshoi volume. The scale for
the gaussian smoothing uses the same value.


After computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors on each point of the
grid we use the matter overdensity, ellipticity and the prolatenes to
further characterize the web. These quantities are defined in terms of the
eigenvalues as follows 
%
\begin{equation}
\delta = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3,
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
e= \frac{\lambda_3 - \lambda_1}{2(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3)}, 
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}
p= \frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_3 - 2\lambda_2}{2(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 +
  \lambda_3)}.
\end{equation}

We are also interested in measuring the alignment of the LG halos with
respect to the cosmic web. To this end we characterize each LG pair by
the vector that is normal to the orbital plane, which is defined by
the position and velocities of each halo with respect to the center of
mass. 


\section{Local Group Analogues}
\label{sec:lg_analogues}

To construct a sample of the MW-M31 pairs at $z\approx 0$, we use a
series of simulation snapshots  at $z<0.1$ (since the last $\approx
1.3$ Gyr) spaced by $\approx 150-250$ Myr. This is done
because a particular configuration of MW and M31 is transient and
corresponds to a relatively small number of systems at one
snapshot. By using multiple snapshots we can increase the sample of
systems in such configuration during a period of time in which secular
cosmological evolution is small. 

The LG analogues or General sample in this paper are pairs selected in relative isolation,
and in a wide range of masses from  $M_{200c}=5 \times 10^{10}$ \msun $ $ to $ 5 \times 10^{13}$ \msun. 
Isolation criteria includes a pair closer than $1.3$\mpc, and with no massive neighbors within $5$\mpc.
In addition we require that pairs have no Virgo-like neighbor halo with mass $M_{200c}>1.5 \times 10^{14}\ \rm M_{\odot}$ within $12$ Mpc. 
We have $5480$ pairs under these general criteria.
A full description of the selection criteria can be found in \citet{lganalogues,sat}. 

We also define two subsamples more closely related to the MW-M31 
dynamics  according to the tolerance in additional constraints:
A sample named $2\sigma$, correspondig to LG analogues constrained by
two times the observational errors in the orbital values (radial
velocity, tangential velocity, and separation), and a more relaxed
sample named $3\sigma$ for LG analogues constrained by three times
observational errors accordingly. The number of pairs in each sample
is $46$ and $120$ respectively, notice we have less pairs than in
\citet{lganalogues} results, since we removed pairs which are too
close at $z=0$, i.e. their virial radii overlaps, also we removed a
couple pairs that merged or change their mass more than $20\%$ at
present time since they were detected at $z<0.1$.  

%We also have a third general sample that we use as a control for our
%results.

\subsection{The prefered environment for LGs}

The first result we explore is the kind of environment occupied by
our LGs. We find that the LGs in the general sample are located across
all different evironment without any strong preferences; $1/3$  are
located in sheets, $1/4$ in peaks, $1/4$ in filaments and the remaning
$1/6$ in voids. 

The situation in the restricted $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ samples is very
different. By large the LGs in these samples are located in
filaments and sheets. In both samples, $\sim 50\%$ of the
pairs can be found in filaments while $\sim 40\%$ are in
in sheets. These absolute numbers in each environment for each sample
are presented in Table \ref{table:web_type}. 

This difference between the general and the restricted samples is mostly due 
the mass ranges covered by each sample. 
In \citet{lganalogues} the mass range covered by $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ 
is very narrow and it is used to constraint the LG mass, then we show 
also in table \ref{table:web_type} a subsample of the General sample
having a similar mass range to $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$, and it reproduces 
similar environment fractions.

A more clear view of this environment dependency and pair mass is shown in
figure \ref{fig:median_fraction}, where we show the mass distribution of pairs
in the different environments, then high mass pairs tend to be located in 
peaks and filaments, and less massive ones in voids and sheets.
Dashed regions represent the $68\%$ confidence intervals of the mass 
distributions of $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ samples.


\subsection{Alignment along the cosmic web}

We explore the alignment of the pairs with respect to the cosmic
web. 
We define the unit vector $\hat{n}$, normal to the pair orbital plane 
computed from the pair positions and relative velocity.
%First we define the unit vector $\hat{r}$ that links the two
%halos. 
Then, we compute the dot product of $\hat{n}$ and each one of
the three eigenvectors for the three samples. 

In Figure
\ref{fig:alignment} we show the main result of that study, it
presents the cumulative distribution of
$\mu\equiv\hat{e}_i\cdot\hat{n}$ for the three eigenvectors $i=1,2,3$. 
Lines indicate the different samples.
The straight line corresponds to the expected result for a
random vector distribution. 

From this Figure we can see two important features:
First, there is a strong anti-alignment signature between $\hat{n}$ 
and the third eigenvector, and this signature reverses with the first eigenvector.
However, in the case of the second eigenvector, no significant deviations are found.
Second, for $\hat{e}_3$ vector the anti-alignment become stronger for 
the samples more closely related to the LG, then for 2$\sigma$ it is 
stronger than for 3$\sigma$, and the latter is stronger than for General 
sample. 

%Figure \ref{fig:scheme} depicts a scheme of the alignment tendencies
%for pairs in all samples, where the pair members positions and 
%velocities tend to align with $\hat{e}_3$ vector.
%The alignment between the peculiar velocities and the $\hat{e}_3$ 
%eigenvector was already reported in \citet{ForeroRomero2014} for all
% halos regardles of its mass.

Quantitatively, the anti-alignment feature found with the $\hat{e}_3$ 
vector means that for 2$\sigma$ sample, $\sim 50\%$ pairs have $\mu<0.2$,
and $\sim 75\%$ pairs have $\mu<0.4$.
We also test that does not change significantly on environment type, in particular 
these trends hold very well for pairs in filaments and walls.

If we consider only pairs in filaments, we have that the pair orbit tends
to be perpendicular to the filament direction, and both pair members lie 
along the filament, if we recall the 3$\sigma$-2$\sigma$ samples are 
constrained with a mostly radial velocity component, then the pairs 
are moving into the filament.
In the case of sheets, we have the pair orbital plane  tend to lie within
 the sheet plane.

These alignment features are in agreement with the scenario that pairs 
created in-situ or falling into a filament/wall align their orbits with 
the large scale structure in a relaxation process where pair members
tend to moves along the slowest collapsing directions.
However, the most intriguing feature is the dependence of this alignment
with how close we represent the LG, is still not clear.
We explore if the pair masses are responsible of this, but we found 
no dependence at all.

In Figure \ref{fig:median_alignment_n} we show the relation between the median 
of $\mu\equiv\hat{e}_i\cdot\hat{n}$ and mass for the general sample, and found 
no significant relation.
Lines in the figure show the median $\mu$-mass relation for the three 
eigenvectors in the General sample.
Dots represent the median $\mu$ for the three eigenvectors in the 
2$\sigma$-3$\sigma$ samples.
In the case of $\|\hat{e}_3\cdot\hat{n}\|$, the figure clearly shows for a fixed mass
range around $1.5-2.0 \times 10^{10}$ \msun, that the median $\mu$ decreases as we
better constraint the LG samples, being larger for General sample and smaller for 
2$\sigma$ sample accordingly.


%From this Figure we first see that there is a clear distinct behavior
%between the general samples and the 3$\sigma$-2$\sigma$ samples. The
%general sample tend to be aligned along the $\hat{e}_3$ vector, the
%3$\sigma$ sample does not show any strong alignment and the 2$\sigma$
%pairs tend to be perpendicular to the $\hat{e}_3$ vector and slightly
%parallel to $\hat{e}_1$. These trends hold in filaments and walls.

%Let's focus on filaments first. That result means that in the general
%sample the two halos tend to lie along the filament, while in the
%2$\sigma$-3$\sigma$ samples they are located perpendicular to the
%filament. If one considers that in these samples the motion is radial,
%that means that the pairs are moving into the filament.

%In the case of sheets, the pairs in the general sample tend to lie on
%the sheet plane along the direction of the slowest collapsing
%direction. In the 2$\sigma$ samples the pairs are not constrained to
%the plane anymore and are perpendiculat to the $\hat{e}_3$
%vector. Considering the preferential radial motion of these pairs,
%that mens that the pairs are moving into the pancake all over a plane that
%is itself perpendicular to the sheet. 


\subsection{Overdensity, Ellipticity and Anisotropy}


We now describe the preferred place of the LG samples in terms of the
overdensity, ellipticiy and anisotropy as defined in Section
\ref{sec:simulation}. 

Figure \ref{fig:median_overdensity} shows dependency of overdensity,
ellipciticy, and prolateness on pair mass for the different samples.
General sample is represented by the solid lines with the associated 
errors covered by the shaded region. 

Left panel shows the overdensity dependence on mass where higher mass
pairs are located in high density regions.
The $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ samples having a narrower mass range as 
shown in previous figure, are consequently located within a narrower 
range of overdensities $0.0<\delta<4.0$ peaking at $\delta \sim 1$. 
This is also consistent with the fact that these samples are mostly 
found in filaments and sheets. 
Average overdensity of $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ samples show no 
significant difference from the General sample within the same mass 
range.  

%Figure \ref{fig:density} shows that the range of overdensities for the
%general pair sample spans almost two orders of magnitude from
%underdense regions $\delta<0$ to high density regions $\delta\sim 30$,
%with a distribution peaking around $\delta \sim 0$. In contrast the
%$2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ samples are located within a narrower range of
%overdensities $0.0<\delta<4.0$ peaking at $\delta \sim 1.5$. This is
%consistent with the fact that these samples are mostly found in
%filaments and sheets.   

Middle and right panels show web ellipciticy and absolute prolateness
dependence on mass. Again we noticed that within the same mass range,
the $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ average ellipciticy and prolateness does not
differ significantly from General sample.
For the $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ samples most of the pairs are located
in a narrow range for ellipticities in the range $0.1<e<1.0$, and
prolateness $0.5<p<0.5$.

%the cumulative distribution for
%the ellipticity and prolateness. The general sample presents a wide
%range in ellipticity that can range from $-30<e<30$. For the $2\sigma$
%and $3\sigma$ samples most of the pairs are now located in a narrow
%range for ellipticities in the range $0.1<e<1.0$. This condition on
%the ellipticity together with the fact that $\delta>0$ implies that
%the prolateness in these samples must be bounded by
%$-1.0<p<1.0$. We actually find that they most of the pairs are bounded
%to an even narrower range $0.5<p<0.5$. 

%Figure \ref{fig:delta_FA} shows two panels with the joint scatter plot
%for the ellipticity and the prolateness as a function of the
%overdensity. For clarity we only include the general and $3\sigma$
%samples. In the left panel (ellipticity) we see the a simple cut in
%the overdensity is not enough to explain the narrow ranges in the
%ellipticity; the LG pairs in the $3\sigma$ sample are located towards
%low ellipticity values. In the right panel (prolateness) we find a
%similar situation; a cut in the overdensity would produced a wider
%distribution in prolateness values than the one featured by the
%$3\sigma$ sample.

\subsection{Spin and Orbital Angular Momentum}

In $4.2$ we defined the unit vector $\hat{n}$, normal to the pair 
orbital plane which can be asociated with the orbital angular 
momentum direction $\hat{J}$.
There, we show several alignment features of the pair orbital
momentum with the environment.
In this subsection we explore the alignement of the individual spin
angular momentum of each pair member $\hat{j_A}$ and $\hat{j_B}$ with
each other and with the orbital angular momentum.

We show in figure \ref{fig:jj_alignment} the cumulative distribution of
dot product between the spin of both members in the pair.
We found a slight alignment of spin vectors for the $2\sigma$ sample.
However, we found no significant alignment between spin and orbital angular 
momentum for any sample.

In the LG, the angle between MW and M31 spin is $\sim60^{\circ}$ and the
angles between spins and orbital angular momentum are $\sim33^{\circ}$
and $\sim76^{\circ}$ for MW and M31 respectively \citep{2012ApJ...753....9V}.
Then the LG show no particular alignement aswell. 

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We explored the characteristics of the LG location in the cosmic web.

LG pairs are preferentially located in filaments and sheets. The mass range
of the pairs sample plays an important role in the fractions for each environment
type as shown in table $1$ and figure $1$.

There is a clear anti-alignment between the third eigenvector and the vector normal 
to the pair orbital plane. This feature is not mass dependant as can be shown in
figure $3$.
For pairs in filaments this means the pair orbit tends to be perpendicular to the 
filament direction, and both pair members lie along the filament, and in the case 
of pairs in sheets, we have the pair orbital plane lie in the sheet plane.
We also found this anti-alignment becomes stronger for the samples being more 
closely related to the LG, it means it is stronger for $2\sigma$ sample.
All these alignment features are consistent with pair orbits relaxing their 
movements towards the slowest collapsing directions at larger scales.

LG pairs are located in a narrow range of local overdensity, ellipciticy and prolateness.
And this is consistent with the narrow mass range selection of specific samples.

The LG spin and orbital angular momentum have no particular alignment,
and we see no significan alignments in our LG pairs, however for the alignment
between pair spins we found a slight alignment signature for $2\sigma$ sample as
can be seen in figure $5$.
